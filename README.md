# complex_cell_chromatic_phase_sens
Matlab code that simulates an experiment testing the sensitivity of V1 complex cells for the relative phase of chromatic and achromatic modulations.
Insensitivity to phase is consistent with the energy model.
Sensitivity to phase may reflect a specialization for naturally occuring edges between different materials.
