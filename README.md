# complex_cell_chromatic_phase_sens
Matlab code that simulates an experiment testing the sensitivity of V1 complex cells for the relative phase difference between chromatic and achromatic modulations.I
Insensitivity to phase is consistent with the energy model.
Sensitivity to phase (0 and 180° > 90°) is consistent with a specialization for naturally occuring edges between different materials.
